2.MongoDB: 

	a)Download the package as per the available version for your operating

	b)system. For Windows, we have to download mongodb-win32-x86_64-enterprise-windows-64-3.0.6-signed.msi.

	c)Run your Installer Wizard, accept the license, and select the complete installation when prompted

	d)After installation, open the mongodb directory and go to the bin folder.

	e)Open the command prompt and run the following command to set the

	f)database path. Choose the path as per your setup:
		i.mongod --dbpath D:\B04569_Chapter_08\Code\serverside-testing\data

	g)Running the previous command will start a server and wait for connections.

	h)Then, open a new command window in the same directory and type mongo to connect with your database:
		i.Mongo

	i)Once you run the mongo command, it will start the database connection, and the MongoDB server will show you the           following line, which acknowledges that the connection is accepted.

	j)Create the database nodedb using the use nodedb command:
		i.use nodedb

	k)Now, create collections to store your TicketDetails. To create a collection for TicketDetails, let's create a 		  variable that holds the schema and data:	
	
collection:
> tickets =
[
{
"email" : "",
"issuetype" : "",
"department" : "",
"ticketstate" : "",
"comments" : "",
"createddate" : ""
}
];
> db.tickets.insert(tickets);
BulkWriteResult({
"writeErrors" : [ ],
"writeConcernErrors" : [ ],
"nInserted" : 1,
"nUpserted" : 0,
"nMatched" : 0,
"nModified" : 0,
"nRemoved" : 0,
"upserted" : [ ]
})

Now, we have our data ready to use in the application.
